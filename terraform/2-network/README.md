# Network Infrastructure Module

This module configures the essential networking infrastructure needed to run the NodeJS application on ECS.

## Components

- **VPC**: Custom VPC with DNS hostnames enabled
- **Subnets**:
  - 2 public subnets (for ALB and NAT Gateways)
  - 2 private subnets (for ECS tasks)
  - Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- **NAT Gateway**: Single NAT Gateway in development (can be scaled for production)
- **Internet Gateway**: Provides internet access for public subnets
- **Route Tables**:
  - Public route table with internet gateway route
  - Private route tables with NAT gateway routes
- **VPC Endpoints**:
  - Amazon ECR API
  - Amazon ECR Docker
  - CloudWatch Logs
  - Amazon S3 Gateway

## Prerequisites

- AWS credentials configured
- Terraform >= 1.0
- AWS provider ~> 5.0

## Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. Review the planned changes:

```bash
terraform plan
```

3. Apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

4. To destroy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Outputs

| Name                           | Description                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| vpc_id                         | ID of the created VPC                      |
| vpc_cidr                       | The CIDR block of the VPC                  |

| vpc_endpoint_s3_id             | The ID of S3 VPC endpoint                  |
| vpc_endpoint_security_group_id | The ID of the VPC endpoints security group |

## Security Considerations

- Private subnets are isolated from direct internet access
- NAT Gateway provides secure outbound internet access for private subnets
- VPC Endpoints reduce data transfer costs and enhance security
- Security group controls access to VPC endpoints
- Network ACLs can be added for additional subnet-level security

## Cost Considerations

Primary cost components:

- NAT Gateway (hourly + data processing)
- VPC Endpoints (hourly)
- Data transfer costs

To reduce costs in non-production environments:

- A single NAT Gateway is used instead of one per AZ
- Careful consideration of required VPC Endpoints
- Monitoring of data transfer patterns

## Notes

- The VPC CIDR (10.0.0.0/16) allows for future expansion
- Subnets are distributed across different AZs for high availability
- NAT Gateway configuration varies by environment (single for dev, multiple for prod)
- IPv6 is not enabled by default but can be added if required

## Regional Considerations

- This module is configured for the Mumbai (ap-south-1) region
- Availability zones are explicitly defined rather than dynamically discovered
- VPC endpoints are region-specific and created in the specified availability zones
- The VPC CIDR (10.0.0.0/16) allows for future expansion
- Subnets are distributed across different AZs for high availability
- NAT Gateway configuration varies by environment (single for dev, multiple for prod)
- IPv6 is not enabled by default but can be added if required
